# GNNs & Neo4j - Examples and Technical Resources
This module is dedicated to example notebooks and other technical resources for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with [Neo4j Graph Data Science](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/).  We will also include some resources for adjacent graph machine learning topics, such graph ML pipelines, non-GNN embeddings, and graph feature engineering.

Demonstrates useful tooling for scaling GNNs to larger graphs that may otherwise be to big to practically train on.                                                                                                                     | [ogbn-arxiv](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv) | Node Classification               | Neo4j Graph Data Science, Pytorch Geometric (PyG) |

This is demonstrated with both GraphSAGE embedding, and FastRP embedding, a non-GNN and traditionally transductive embedding, which still seems to perform well.                                                            | [ogbn-arxiv](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv) | Node Classification               | Neo4j Graph Data Science, PyTorch                 |
