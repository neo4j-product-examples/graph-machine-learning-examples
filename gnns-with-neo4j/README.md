# GNNs & Neo4j - Examples and Technical Resources
This module is dedicated to example notebooks and other technical resources for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with [Neo4j Graph Data Science](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/).  We will also include some resources for adjacent graph machine learning topics, such graph ML pipelines, non-GNN embeddings, and graph feature engineering.

Demonstrates useful tooling for scaling GNNs to larger graphs that may otherwise be to big to practically train on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [ogbn-arxiv](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv) | Node Classification               | Neo4j Graph Data Science, Pytorch Geometric (PyG) |
| [Use FastRP or GraphSAGE Node Embedding to Improve Downstream Model Performance](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/graph-machine-learning-examples/blob/main/inductive-node-classifiaction-ml-integration/example.ipynb)                           | Example shows how Neo4j node embeddings can be used to improve downstream model performance in an __*inductive*__ setting where the graph grows over time.  This is demonstrated with both GraphSAGE and FastRP embedding. [FastRP](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp/) is a non-GNN, and traditionally transductive, embedding method. However, Neo4j's implementation can be configured for greater stability on updating graphs and seems to perform well in this setting. | [ogbn-arxiv](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv) | Node Classification               | Neo4j Graph Data Science, PyTorch                 |
